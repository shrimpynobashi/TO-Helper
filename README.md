# TO-Helper
Command prompt-based menu to assist tournament organizers/streamers organize their tournament layouts.

Summary:

  Console version: By running the script/executeable, it generates 4 text files in the same folder (p1name, p2name, p1wins, p2wins) that can be "pointed at" using streaming suites (OBS/Xsplit/etc.) using the Text option (and checking "read from file"). Doing that will display the text files on-screen. The script then runs a menu that you can customize it, such as change player names and wins. It allows you to "queue" the next match up, requiring you to use the Submit Names key before it changes the names (and reset score).
  
  Fix Menu allows you to, without having to Submit names again, to fix the names and wins.
  
  
  
  GUI version: generates 4 text files in the same folder it's ran that can be "pointed at" with your streaming suite's Text option (checking "read from file"). "Submit" will reset the scores and change the names to what you have in the fields, "Clear" will reset scores and names to "Player 1" and "Player 2", "Fix Names" will set the names to what you have in the fields WITHOUT changing wins, and "Swap" will swap the names and wins for the players (for all you Soulcalibur players. You're welcome).
