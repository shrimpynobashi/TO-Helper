# TO-Helper
Command prompt-based menu to assist tournament organizers/streamers organize their tournament layouts.

Summary:
  By running the script/executeable, it generates 4 text files in the same folder (p1name, p2name, p1wins, p2wins) that can be "pointed at" using streaming suites (OBS/Xsplit/etc.) using the Text option (and checking "read from file"). Doing that will display the text files on-screen. The script then runs a menu that you can customize it, such as change player names and wins. It allows you to "queue" the next match up, requiring you to use the Submit Names key before it changes the names (and reset score).
  Fix Menu allows you to, without having to Submit names again, to fix the names and wins. For the names, it runs a subfunction and then writes it directly to the file, and it's just an input prompt for the wins, because I still haven't had coffee since I started this project.
  Feel free to make any suggestions through github or on Twitter! @Shrimpynobashi
